# Coursera-Week-4-Coding
"Module 4 Coding Assignment"
Coursera course: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers

-using Javascript to loop through an array-

Assignment: Loop over an array of names and print out either a hello or goodbye to that name in the browser console. 
If the name starts with a letter j or J, you are to print out "Goodbye J_SomeName". If the name starts with any other letter, print out "Hello _SomeName".

However, in order to do that printing you will have to use 2 externally provided libraries whose code is not 100% ready to be used. Fix the code in those libraries.

You will get some starter code to work with.

Download the starter files for this project and copy them into your solution container folder (e.g., into module4-solution). 'Git clone' the course4 repository into a new directory OR, if you've already done 'git clone' previously, simply open up your command prompt (cmd on Windows or Terminal on Mac), navigate to the folder where the fullstack-course4 repository was previously cloned into and do: 'git pull'.

NOTE: the provided starter code will not run. It is up to you to follow the instructions to get it to run. Once you've copied the starter code of your choice into your solution folder, open up your solution folder in the code editor. Open up script.js file and follow the steps.

When you are continuously working on the assignment, use Browser Sync and keep Chrome open to the Console tab of the Chrome Developer Tools. You will likely see errors there to start with. Follow the steps outlined in the starter code and those errors should go away by the time you finish the last step. If you still see errors at that point or you are not seeing the output you're supposed to see, you probably made a mistake somewhere, so look into that and investigate.
